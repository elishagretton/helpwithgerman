# helpwithgerman
C++ Program to help users read German

How the program works:
- user inputs the german text they are studying, german vocabulary (words they know), corresponding file with english translation of each word in german vocabulary file
- program looks through text and highlights words the user does know
- user can search words they want to know translation of
- user can input translation of words they do not know after looking them up
- friendly user interface so program is easy to use
- user can save a new vocab list of words they knew before, and words they have just found out

Future goals with this program:
- change how user inputs their text, german and english files
- instead of the user looking up the word, the program should already know the translation of words the user doesn't know. This would be more useful. Maybe look up an algorithm or take data from an online resource? Would need to research this.
- better highlighting and change user interface so it is nicer. Implement a hover feature instead of search feature.
- test program with larger text 
- add language features, look into Regex
- very ambitious: use some algorithm/ml technique where if the user knows one word, the program can predict the user knows words related to it. e.g. if they know the word Spiel in German, they probably know words like spielen, Spieler, Spielplatz, Kriegspiel.
